Steps to create your production Dockerfile

Steps for Setting up CI/CD Pipeline in Travis CI 
    Login to Travis CI with your github account
    Select the Repository
    Create and configure the .travis.yml file in your codebase

Whenever npm run test is command is executed , it never exits from the porgram and hangs in there , this can be a problem in Travis
as travis waits for npm run test to complete and exit on its own .
Hence , we can use npm run test -- -- coverage (This will execute the test , show the test coverage and exit the programs)
